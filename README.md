# help-me-please
There is a bug in my game, where if I shoot foward in a 90 degree cone, I end up shooting myself.
This bug has persisted, and I don't know how to fix it. I have started, and given up on multiple projects due to being lazy.
I am passionate about this one, and want to get it out to the world, but my lack of knowledge on coding means I cannot fix this bug.
I request help before I give up on this one too.
